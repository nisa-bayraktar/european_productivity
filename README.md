# European Productivity
# About the Project 
The project aims to investigate European productivity from 2008 to 2019 for fifteen European countries, by measuring the GDP per hour worked and the impact of different features on this. These features are education, depression, inflation and unemployment. To investigate productivity, dimen- sionality reduction, clustering algorithms, linear and penalised regression, a SARIMA model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) are applied to the data. For more information about the project and my contribution please check the report in the European_Productivity_Report.pdf file.
